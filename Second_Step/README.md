# Scope
    Location where variable is defined dictates access to it
    Blocks are denoted by {} 
    var has different scoping rules

## Functions are also objects!
    can be stored in objects, used as arguments, and returned
    function factories can be created!

### Compiler 
    first initializes the variables(var, function) (hoisting)
    let declarations are not hoisted
